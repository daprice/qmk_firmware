This is [my](https://github.com/daprice) layout intended for easy use with MacOS and iOS and with some personal customizations.

Compared to the default Gergo layout, this layoutâ€¦

- assigns the thumb keys to be more familiar for Mac users used to using our thumbs for Command key shortcuts and the Option key for special characters
- makes the Option key (used for special characters on Mac/iOS) easier to use especially combined with the number layer
- ditches mouse movement keys based on the assumption that you have a comfortable trackpad right next to or between your Gergo halves
- ditches F1-F12, which are scarcely used as PC-standard function keys on MacOS, in favor of having vim-style arrow keys on BOTH HALVES
- uses a vim-inspired layout for media keys, with rewind, vol-, vol+, and fast-forward directly below left, down, up, and right in the function layer, and the space bar used for play/pause in the function layer

## Settings
To edit various settings, enable the 1u trackball and whatnot please modify /keyboards/gergo/keymaps/default/rules.mk
